# MRI Brain Tumor Classification (TensorFlow + Colab)

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that trains a CNN model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Dataset
NINS MRI Dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudipde25/mri-dataset-for-detection-and-analysis

The dataset is downloaded inside Colab using `kaggle` library.  
**Dataset is NOT included in this repo.**

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`)
3. Run all cells to train the model

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle API
- Google Colab
